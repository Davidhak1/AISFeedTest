Propriétaire actuel d’un véhicule BMW / MINI de l’année modèle 2011 à 2018; OU propriétaire actuel d’un véhicule BMW / MINI d’une année modèle antérieure à 2011, seulement si le véhicule fait l’objet d’un contrat de SF en vigueur; OU propriétaire précédent d’un véhicule BMW / MINI dont le contrat de SF s’est terminé dans les trois derniers mois. Les achats par MINI SF doivent être financés par le programme de taux pour clients fidèles (ou l’équivalent) (p. ex., SB18-xxLOY). Le détaillant doit passer un contrat électronique réussi en utilisant « LOY » et indiquer le programme « LOY » sur l’avis d’approbation. S’applique à tous les nouveaux produits MINI de crédit-bail, FlexiLease, bail à versement unique, financement et OwnersChoice. En cas de fidélité intermarque, le programme de fidélité pour la marque achetée s’appliquera (p. ex., un client de MINI qui achète un véhicule BMW recevra l’offre pour clients fidèles de BMW). Cette offre peut être combinée avec la remise pour crédit-bail à multiples dépôts de garantie. Cette offre ne peut pas être utilisée pour les achats de véhicules d’occasion ou avec refinancement. Le taux ne peut pas être inférieur au taux d’intérêt le plus bas possible, à savoir 0,10 %. Ce programme ne s’applique pas à la vente de véhicules d’occasion. Les options de fidélité ne peuvent pas être combinées. Par exemple, un client ne peut pas utiliser à la fois le rabais sur le taux pour clients fidèles et le programme pour devancement du bail. Drive Your Brand (DYB) et les contrats promotionnels ne sont pas admissibles. La disponibilité du programme dépend du processus de financement correct. La sélection du bon code de financement est la responsabilité du détaillant. Les affaires de fidélité mal financées ne seront pas admissibles à la réduction du taux pour clients fidèles. Les affaires qui bénéficient d’avantages seront vérifiées à la fin du moins pour assurer la conformité avec l’admissibilité aux programmes. Un abus du programme de fidélité entraînera une vérification du net du détaillant sans préavis relativement à la réduction. Les véhicules américains peuvent être utilisés comme NIV de fidélité seulement, mais ne peuvent pas être revendus dans le cadre d’un contrat de MINI SF. Les membres de la famille qui demeurent sous le même toit que le client admissible peuvent recevoir les avantages de fidélité dans le cadre d’un achat admissible. Les clients admissibles peuvent réutiliser leur NIV de fidélité admissible pour leurs futurs achats afin de recevoir des avantages de fidélité (sous réserve de la disponibilité). BMW Group Canada se réserve le droit de modifier ou de résilier ce programme en tout temps. En cas de fidélité intermarque, le programme de fidélité pour le nouveau véhicule s’appliquera (p. ex., un client de MINI qui achète un véhicule BMW recevra l’offre pour clients fidèles de BMW). Ce programme ne s’applique pas à la vente de véhicules d’occasion. Les options de fidélité ne peuvent pas être combinées. Par exemple, un client ne peut pas utiliser à la fois le rabais sur le taux pour clients fidèles et le crédit pour clients fidèles.

Si le client admissible choisit de louer ou de financer un véhicule neuf et jamais immatriculé de marque Nissan (sauf NV, parc et location à la journée) par l’entremise de Nissan Canada Finance, il recevra un montant spécifié de dollars de fidélité cumulables. Par ailleurs, si le client admissible choisit d’acheter, de louer ou de financer un véhicule admissible neuf (sauf GT-R et LEAF™) autrement que par l’entremise de Nissan Canada Finance, il recevra un plan de changement d’huile et de rotation des pneus de trois ans ou 48 000 kilomètres (selon le premier des deux), comprenant un maximum de 6 visites d’entretien, chacune consistant en un changement d’huile (en utilisant une huile moteur conventionnelle 5W30) et une rotation des pneus. Les dollars de fidélité peuvent être appliqués selon une ou plus des quatre (4) façons suivantes : – Pour réduire le taux annuel en pourcentage (« taux ») sur un véhicule admissible neuf loué ou financé par l’entremise de Nissan Canada Finance. – À l’achat du Programme sécuritaire prolongé (« PSP ») de Nissan. – En tant que déduction après les taxes sur le prix final d’un véhicule admissible neuf. – Pour compenser vos paiements de location ou de financement pour votre véhicule Nissan actuel, ou pour les pénalités ou autres montants associés à la résiliation de votre contrat de financement ou de location actuel. Ventes admissibles : Types de ventes O et L (vente au détail seulement), sauf celles déclarées comme : exportation, perte d’assurance, crédit-bail Live the Brand, pièces pour camions, navettes des concessionnaires, parc et location à la journée. Clients admissibles : L’offre pour clients fidèles de Nissan n’est accessible que par les clients admissibles qui, dans les 90 jours qui précèdent la date de la location, du financement ou de l’achat d’un véhicule neuf admissible (défini ci-dessous), ont loué ou financé un véhicule de marque Nissan 2007 ou plus récent ou en étaient propriétaires. La règle de propriété de 90 jours n’est pas en vigueur si le client a acheté un véhicule d’année modèle 2015, 2016 ou 2017 au cours des 90 derniers jours – Le programme de fidélité ne sera appliqué qu’à la deuxième transaction. Il s’agit d’un rabais offert par le fabricant au consommateur; les concessionnaires devraient donc inclure cet incitatif sur les contrats de vente après le calcul des taxes.","programID":1539,"shortTitle":"loy","title":"Comptant de fidélisation/pour diplômés de NCF","taxStatus":"PostTax","priceBase":"","compatiblePrograms":[21038,18679,9396,21040,11474,12111,15789,21039,12840,21037,10915]},"3833":{"consumer":"Le programme de fidélité offre une réduction de 1 % du taux publié le plus bas pour la location, le financement au détail ou Star Advantage pour une fourgonnette Mercedes-Benz neuve Admissibilité des clients aux voitures Mercedes-Benz : pour être admissible, un client doit avoir loué ou financé une fourgonnette Mercedes-Benz neuve ou d’occasion par l'entremise de Services financiers Mercedes-Benz.
